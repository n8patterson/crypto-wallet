## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7.9 with the following packages:

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - A platform to quickly share python code over the web.

* [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - A Python library for connecting to and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchains.

* [ethereum-tester](https://pypi.org/project/ethereum-tester/0.1.0a4/) - A Python library that provides access to the tools weâ€™ll use to test Ethereum-based applications.

* [mnemonic](https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/) - A Python implementation for generating a 12- or 24-word mnemonic seed phrase based on the BIP-39 standard.

* [bip44](https://pypi.org/project/bip44/) - A Python implementation for deriving hierarchical deterministic wallets from a seed phrase based on the BIP-44 standard.

* [Infura API](https://infura.io/) - An API that provides instant access to the Ethereum network over HTTPS (i.e., the web). You will need to create an account with Infura.

On the terminal, under the conda dev environment, install the following:
